# coding-ui-practice

This is a single page website created as a practice project to convert a UI/UX design into a working website using only HTML and CSS, ReactJS, JSX, and Vite. The website features a modern design with a fixed layout that is not responsive. It includes a navigation menu that scrolls smoothly to different sections of the page and interactive hover effects on buttons and links.

The website is a stock broker dashboard with a clean and modern design. The UI/UX design was created by me and can be viewed on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/IOS6KcVjnmhIHGbMXy6JGZ/broker?node-id=2-2). The live website can be viewed at https://omidneshati-coding-ui.netlify.app/.

Please note that the buttons on the website do not currently work as other pages have not been created. This project is solely intended as a practice exercise to convert a UI/UX design to code.

To view the website, you should open it on a desktop or laptop computer. The website may not display properly on mobile devices or tablets.
